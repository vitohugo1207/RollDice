The rolldice can roll dice at the interval that you choose, times as you want and sum bonus. And return list of rolls (with bonus if add) and total roll.<br>
Sintax example:
```
2d30+4
``` 
"2" is amount of times the dice will be rolled, "30" is the max number of dice and "+4" is the bonus will be sum in total roll. If this command for used without amount of time, it will roll just one time; without "30" it will return error; without "+4", obviously, it will return without any bonus, the bonus supported is ``+`` ``-``, ``*`` or ``/``. <br>
Return example:
```

List of dice roll: 3, 27, +4
Total of dice roll: 34
```
